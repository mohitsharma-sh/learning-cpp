# learning-cpp
Notes from different sources I am using to learn cpp.

## 1. C++ Fundamentals Including C++ 17 (Kate Gregory)
## 2. [UPenn CIS 190, C++ Programming](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis190/fall2019/)

1. Homework 1  
    - Overloading of `>>` and `<<` operator (return types, `const`ness).
    - Return types of overloaded operators (why `+=` should return a self reference)
    - `iostream`, `fstream`

2. Homework 2
    - Core Concepts: Abstract Classes, Polymorphism, Inheritence
    - C++: `virtual`, `pure virtual`, `protected`, `std::initializer_list`
