# C++ Fundamentals Including C++

- Keep in mind what compiler you use, it would make a difference in terms of what features are available to you.
- Two important websites  
    1. [CPP Standards](https://isocpp.org/)
    2. [CPP Reference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/) 

- Building C++ code  
    1. Compiling (create object files)
    2. Linking (combine multiple object files into an executable)

- Language Basics
    - Fundamental Types (numbers, boolean, single characters)
    - User Defined Types (string, dates, ...)
    - Struct and classes
    - Prefix: 0x  for hexadecimal, 0b for binary (introduced in Cpp14)
    - Overflow and underflow error
    - Casting
        - static_cast\<int>(var)
- User Defined Classes
    - Header files for declaration, Linker will make sure that a declaration has a corresponding implementation in some object
    - Constructors  
        - Initializers for member variables
        - Default constructors
